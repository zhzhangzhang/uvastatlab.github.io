      <description>What is Shiny?Shiny is an R package that facilitates the creation of interactive web apps using R code, which can be hosted locally, on the shinyapps server, or on your own server. Shiny apps can range from extremely simple to incredibly sophisticated. They can be written purely with R code or supplemented with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Visit R studioâ€™s shiny gallery to view some examples. Among its many uses, shiny apps are a great way for researchers to engage others with their work and collected data.</description>
